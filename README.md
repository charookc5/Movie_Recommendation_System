Overview

This project builds a **content-based recommender** that recommends movies similar to a selected one by analyzing features like genre, description, keywords, and more from the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset.

## Key Concepts & Terminology

* **Content-based Recommendation**: A system that suggests items similar to what the user likes, based solely on item attributes (e.g., genres, keywords).

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**: Measures how important a word is within one document (e.g. movie description) relative to a collection of documents. It helps identify the most distinctive features for similarity.

* **Cosine Similarity**: A metric that measures similarity between two vectors by computing the cosine of the angle between them; values range from 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical).

* **Feature Vector**: A numerical representation that encodes attributes of each movie (e.g., genres, keywords) for computational comparison.

* **TMDB Dataset**: A comprehensive collection of movie metadata (titles, descriptions, genres, etc.) provided by The Movie Database (TMDB).

## Features

* Load and preprocess TMDB movie data
* Generate feature vectors using TF-IDF
* Compute pairwise cosine similarity between movies
* Return recommendations based on similarity scores
* Interactive script or notebook to test recommendations
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

## Installation


# 1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Using `app.py`

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a simple web or command-line interface to input a movie title and receive recommendations.

### Exploring via Notebook

Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

Run the cells to explore:

* Data loading and exploration
* TF-IDF vector creation
* Similarity computation
* Visualization or interactive recommendations

## Code Walkthrough

### Data Loading & Cleaning

* Reads CSV files with TMDB movie metadata.
* Selects relevant columns (e.g., title, overview, genres, keywords).
* Cleans and handles missing data.

### Feature Engineering

* Combines textual and categorical features into a unified text field.
* Applies TF-IDF vectorization to encode each movie into a numerical vector.

### Similarity Computation

* Computes cosine similarity matrix for all movies.
* Stores similarity scores for quick lookup.

### Fetching Recommendations

* Given a movie title, the system finds its index.
* Retrieves and sorts similarity scores to find top matches.
* Prints or displays similar movie recommendations with score.

## How It Works: Workflow Explanation

1. **Input**: User selects or inputs a movie title.
2. **Vectorization**: Build or retrieve the TF-IDF vector for that movie.
3. **Similarity Lookup**: Compare this vector against all others using cosine similarity.
4. **Output**: Return the top-N most similar movies with their similarity scores.

## Possible Enhancements

* **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combine content-based filtering with collaborative signals (e.g., user ratings).
* **Feature Expansion**: Incorporate director, cast, release date, or popularity.
* **Semantic Embeddings**: Replace TF-IDF with word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).
* **Web Interface**: Create a user-friendly front-end using Flask, Streamlit, or React.
* **Performance Optimization**: Use approximate nearest neighbor libraries (like FAISS) for faster similarity search.
